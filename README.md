Angular.js-Flickr-Gallery
=========================

Angular.js Flickr Gallery using CoffeeScript + jQuery (for some small things I haven't figured out how to do in Angular.js yet)

You can use your left and right arrow keys to jump to the previous and next photos and pages.

Running locally on pow using powder (hence the public dir).
